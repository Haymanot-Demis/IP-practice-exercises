       I recently read The True Believer by Eric Hoffer. It’s a book about how mass movements evolve. 
       With a lot of historical examples, the book explains the patterns and common threads among them. 
       It’s an insightful book and reading it was a great learning experience for me.

         What I’d like to share with you here is not the content of the book, though. 
         Instead, I’d like to share with you about the author. You see, I didn’t know about Eric Hoffer before.
         But I imagined he must be a famous professor from a well-known university. I mean, what else could explain the depth of his insights? 
         The True Believer is an influential book. Here is how <a href = "wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> put it... <a href = "read more.html">read
